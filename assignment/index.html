    <h1>Week 4 Assignment - Part 3</h1>
    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul>
      <li>On line 7 in cart.js file, I tested the basket variable to ensure it
      result in an empty array. When looking in the console, it shows an empty
      array, but when I click the arrow to open it, it lists the items 'broccoli',
      'apples', and 'cookies' which I do not add in cart.js file until lines 14-16.
      How come the items show up there and is there something I need to change
      in my code to get rid of that?</li>
      <li>Does a function not require a return statement?</li>
    </ul>
